Remix it up
B3 is here with the flames pack it up aye
Back with the beats
Come here go take a seat
Cause we got a new face and you know that it's heat mann 
Freaky on a Friday
back in yo place cause you know that it's my day
out my face cause I'm rappin with my bae
Have a rap battle with her dad on a fine day
You know that we cool
Have you go back to school
We made everything new
Now the haters a fool
And you know that we rule 
On the stage that we duel
Where you fightin a ghoul
Now yo balls are azul
Freaky on a Friday
back in yo place cause you know that it's my day
out of my face cause I'm rappin with my bae
Have a rap battle with her dad on a fine day
