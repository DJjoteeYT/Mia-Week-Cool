:gf:smug: Hey Pico... I just checked the stream on my phone, it looks like BF is getting more popular than you.
:pico:angry: What the fuck do you mean he's getting more popular than me?! We've been rapping for only a few hours!
:bf:smug: Bep bo!
:gf:scared: 10 million viewers. Holy shit, that's a lot. 
:gf:smug: Too bad more than half of them are rooting for my baby!
:pico:annoyed:This is the most viewers I've ever had on a live stream, I'm not gonna let my ex just embarrass me live!
:gf:angry: Wait, WHY ARE THEY ASKING IF HE'S SINGLE IN CHAT?!
:pico:annoyed: Fine. Get ready for that song that everyone knows cause it was in that one Friday Night Funkin animation that also got a mod!
:gf:reallysmug: that's awfully specific.
