:bf:depressed:boop...
:dad:smug:Is this your first time in front of hundreds of people? 
:bf:angry:bap...
:dad:smug:I'm guessing that means yes. You speak quite an old language you know? Last time I heard it was 300 years ago. It'd be a shame if you died so early in your life.
:bf:smug:bloop!
:dad:smile:But unfortunately, it's what's going to happen.
