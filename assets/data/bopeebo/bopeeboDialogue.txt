:dad:smile:Hello, boy.
:bf:depressed:boop...
:dad:smug:Is this your first time in front of hundreds of people? 
:bf:angry:bap...
:dad:smug:I'm guessing that means yes. 
:dad:smug:You know, the language you speak quite outdated. You're probably one the only people in the world who speak this way.
:gf:bruh:Dad, why does this matter?
:dad:smug:I'm saying that it'd be a shame if one of the only people in the world who speak this language fluently died today.
:gf:embarresed: So... you'll let him go?
:dad:smile: Only if he breaks up with you.
:gf:scared:...
:bf:angry:bloop!
:dad:smile:But it seems like he doesn't want to live.
:dad:smug:Don't worry, I won't make it TOO hard.
