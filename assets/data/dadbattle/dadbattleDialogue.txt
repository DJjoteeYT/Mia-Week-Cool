:dad:angry:Ok, now you've pissed me off. I've been raising her for 100 years. I'm not gonna let some college dropout from the middle of nowhere have my daughter! 
:bf:angry:Boop bo! 
:dad:angry: She may be an adult now, but she has no clue what she's doing. She's still a clumsy little brat. I need to protect her.
:bf:smug: Bap!
:dad:angrysmile: You'll protect her huh? 
:dad:angrysmile: Hah, you can't protect her if you're dead!
